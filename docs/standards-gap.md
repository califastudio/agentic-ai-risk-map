# Existing AI Standards & the Agentic Gap

## Overview

Current AI governance frameworks were designed with a common assumption:
a human is always responsible somewhere in the chain.

Agentic AI systems break that assumption.

This document maps the major international standards and frameworks,
identifies where they assume human oversight, and surfaces the gaps
that emerge when autonomous agents operate without direct human control.

## 1. NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)

*What it says:*
The NIST AI RMF organizes risk management around four functions:
Govern, Map, Measure, and Manage. It emphasizes human oversight,
accountability, and organizational responsibility throughout the AI lifecycle.

*Where it assumes a human:*
- Accountability is assigned to organizations and individuals
- Risk management requires human judgment at key decision points
- Incident response assumes human actors who can intervene

*The agentic gap:*
When an agent autonomously executes transactions, creates entities,
or coordinates with other agents — who is the "organization" accountable?
The RMF has no mechanism for non-human operational actors.

## 2. EU AI Act

*What it says:*
The EU AI Act classifies AI systems by risk level and assigns obligations
to providers and deployers. High-risk systems require human oversight,
transparency, and conformity assessments.

*Where it assumes a human:*
- "Deployer" is defined as a human or legal entity
- Human oversight is a mandatory requirement for high-risk systems
- Liability flows through identifiable human or corporate actors

*The agentic gap:*
An autonomous agent that deploys itself, operates independently,
and interacts with financial or legal systems has no clear classification.
Is it a provider? A deployer? Neither?
The Act was not designed for self-operating non-human actors.

## 3. ISO/IEC 42001 — AI Management Systems

*What it says:*
ISO 42001 provides a management system standard for organizations
developing or using AI. It focuses on governance, risk, and controls
within organizational structures.

*Where it assumes a human:*
- Designed for organizations with human leadership and oversight
- Controls assume human decision-makers who implement and monitor them
- Audit and accountability mechanisms require human actors

*The agentic gap:*
Agentic systems may operate across organizational boundaries or
entirely outside traditional organizational structures.
ISO 42001 has no framework for governing autonomous systems
that act as independent operational units.

## 4. OECD AI Principles

*What it says:*
The OECD Principles call for AI that is transparent, accountable,
robust, and respects human rights. They emphasize human-centered values
and meaningful human oversight.

*Where it assumes a human:*
- Accountability is assigned to human actors in the AI value chain
- "Meaningful human oversight" is a core principle
- Values alignment assumes human judgment as the reference point

*The agentic gap:*
When agents coordinate autonomously, make decisions at machine speed,
and operate across jurisdictions — meaningful human oversight
becomes structurally impossible without deliberate architectural design.

## 5. The Core Gap: Human-in-the-Loop Assumptions

All major frameworks share a foundational assumption:

> There is always an identifiable human or organization
> that can be held responsible, can intervene, and can be regulated.

Agentic AI systems challenge this at every level:

| Assumption | Agentic Reality |
|---|---|
| Identifiable responsible actor | Distributed across models, tools, developers, users |
| Human can intervene | Autonomous execution at machine speed |
| Decisions are traceable | Multi-step reasoning across opaque systems |
| Jurisdiction is clear | Cross-border autonomous operations |
| Oversight is continuous | Agents operate 24/7 without human monitoring |

## Open Questions for Governance

- Should autonomous agents be required to register as operational entities?
- What mandatory human checkpoints should exist before high-impact actions?
- How do existing liability frameworks apply when no human made the decision?
- Which actions should autonomous agents be permanently prohibited from taking?
- How can auditability be built into agentic architectures by design?
